<!-- 
    What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in
    HTML?

    Block-level elements:
    Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width 
    available. They create a "block" of content. Examples: <div>, <p>, 
    <h1>, <ul>, <table>.

    inline elements:
    Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width 
    as needed. They flow within a line of text. Examples: <span>, <a>, 
    <strong>, <img>, <em>.

  <!-- Block-level element -->
  <div style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    This is a block-level element (div). It starts on a new line and takes up the full width.
  </div>

  <!-- Inline element inside a paragraph -->
  <p>
    This is a paragraph. <span style="color: red;">This is an inline element (span)</span> inside it.
