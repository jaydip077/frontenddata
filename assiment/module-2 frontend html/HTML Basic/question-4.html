Discuss the role of semantic HTML.
 Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags to describe the structure and 
 content of a web page, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, 
<section>, and <footer>.

    understand the content better, making it more accessible to users with 
    disabilities. Semantic HTML also improves SEO by providing search engines 
    with clearer information about the page's structure and content.
