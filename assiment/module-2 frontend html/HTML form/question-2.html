     the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission.

     GET and POST are two methods used to submit forms in HTML.

     GET:
        - The GET method appends form data to the URL in name/value pairs.
        - Data is visible in the browser's address bar.
        - with this methos user can send limited amount of data.
        - It is suitable for non-sensitive data and when bookmarking or sharing the URL is needed.


    POST:
        - The POST method sends form data in the body of the HTTP request.
        - Data is not visible in the URL.
        - It allows for larger amounts of data to be sent.
        - It is suitable for sensitive data, such as passwords, and when data integrity is important.

     

        When should you use GET 
        You should use the GET method when you want to retrieve
        data from a server without making any changes to the server’s data.
        GET is ideal for actions like searching, filtering, or displaying 
        information, where the request is safe and can be repeated without 
        side effects. Avoid using GET for sensitive data or actions that
        modify data.


         When should you use POST
        You should use the POST method when you want to send data to the server
        that will create, update, or delete resources. POST is ideal for
        submitting forms with sensitive or large amounts of data, such as login 
        forms, registration, uploading files, or saving information. Use POST 
        whenever the action changes server data or should not be repeated 
        accidentally.
