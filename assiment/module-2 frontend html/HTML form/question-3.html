<!-- What is the purpose of the label element in a form
     
     The purpose of the label element in a form is to define a label for an 
     input element. It improves accessibility by associating descriptive text 
     with a specific form control, making it easier for all users—including 
     those using screen readers—to understand what information is required. 
     Clicking the label also focuses or activates the corresponding input field.

     how does it improve accessibility?
     
     The label element improves accessibility by associating descriptive text 
     with form controls, allowing screen readers to announce the label when a 
     user focuses on an input. This helps visually impaired users understand 
     what information is required and makes forms easier to use for people with 
     motor impairments by increasing the clickable area. This explanation has
