        Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes?

        Tables should be used sparingly for layout purposes because they 
        make web pages less accessible, harder to maintain, and less flexible 
        for different devices. Using tables for layout can confuse screen 
        readers, slow down page loading, and make responsive design difficult.
        Modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid are better for creating 
        layouts. This explanation has been added as a comment in your file.

        A better alternative to using tables for layout is to use CSS layout 
        techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid. These methods provide more 
        control, flexibility, and responsiveness for modern web design, making 
        pages easier to maintain and more accessible. This explanation has been
