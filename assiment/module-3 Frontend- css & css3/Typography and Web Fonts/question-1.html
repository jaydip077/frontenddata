<!--  Why might you use a web-safe font over a custom font?
  
1. Speed & Performance Matter: No extra downloads, so the page loads faster.

2. Offline or Limited Internet Access: The text still renders correctly without relying on external font files.

3. Fallback or Simplicity: For simple sites, system fonts are good enough and consistent.

4. Email Design: Email clients often block custom fonts, so web-safe fonts ensure consistency.
