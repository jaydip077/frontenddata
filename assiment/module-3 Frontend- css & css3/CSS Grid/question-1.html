  <!-- When would you use Grid over Flexbox?

 1. You need a two-dimensional layout
Grid handles rows and columns at the same time.
Perfect when you’re designing full-page layouts or dashboards.

2. You want precise control over placement
You can position items in specific grid cells or make them span multiple rows/columns.

3. You know your layout structure in advance
Grid is ideal when you have a fixed or predictable layout, such as a landing page, gallery, or admin panel.

4. You need equal rows and columns
Grid makes it easy to create uniform boxes.
