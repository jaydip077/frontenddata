                <p>What is CSS Flexbox.  <br>

                    CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout model in CSS that allows you to design complex layouts easily and efficiently. It helps you align and distribute space among items in a container — even when their size is unknown or dynamic.-->

                     how is it useful for layout design? <br>
                    
                    It makes responsive and adpative:<br>
                    Itmes can grow shrink and wrap based on available space.

                    Simplifies aligment:<br>
                    Flexbox provides powerful alignment options for both horizontal and vertical alignment of items within a container.

                    Control over spacing:<br>
                    gap,justify and margin properties allow for precise control over spacing between items.

                    creates equal-height rows and flexible column without floats or complex calculations.

                    allows for reordering of items without changing the HTML structure.<br>
                    <hr>

                    Explain the terms flex-container and flex-item.<br>

                    Flex-container:<br>

                    The element that has display: flex (or inline-flex).<br>

                    Establishes a flex formatting context and controls layout of its direct children.<br>

                    Container-level properties: flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, gap, align-content.<br>

                    Flex-item:<br>

                    Any direct child of a flex-container.<br>

                    Its size and position are controlled by item-level properties: flex (grow/shrink/basis), order, align-self, margin.<br>

                    Flex items participate in the container’s distribution of space and alignment.<br>

                        Describe the properties justify-content, align-items, and flex- 
                        direction used in Flexbox.<br>

                        justify-content:<br>
                        justify content provides alignment along the main axis of the flex container.<br>
                        <hr>
                        values of justify-content:<br>
                        flex-start:set items at the start of the container.<br>
                        flex-end: set items at the end of the container.<br>
                        center: center items in the container.<br>
                        space-between: distribute items evenly with first item at start and last item at end.<br>
                        space-around: distribute items evenly with equal space around them.<br>
                        space-evenly: distribute items with equal space between and around them.<br>
                        <hr>
                        align-items:<br>
                        align-items provides alignment along the cross axixs of the flex container.<br>
                        <hr>
                        values of align-items:<br>
                        flex-start: align items at the start of the cross axis.<br>
                        flex-end: align items at the end of the cross axis.<br>
                        center: center items along the cross axis.<br>
                        stretch: stretch items to fill the container along the cross axis.<br>
                        baseline: align items along their text baselines.<br>
                        <hr>
                        flex-direction:<br>
                        flex-direction defines the direction of the main axis and the direction in which flex items are placed in the flex container.<br>
                        values of flex-direction:<br>
                        row: items are placed in a row from left to right.<br>
                        row-reverse: items are placed in a row from right to left.<br>
                        column: items are placed in a column from top to bottom.<br>
                        column-reverse: items are placed in a column from bottom to top.<br>
