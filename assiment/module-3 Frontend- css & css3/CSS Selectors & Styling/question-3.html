What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the 
advantages and disadvantages of each approach.  


Inline css:
    Applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.
    
        Advantages:
        Quick for small, specific changes; overrides other CSS rules easily.
    
        Disadvantages:
        Not reusable; can lead to messy HTML and harder maintenance.


Internal css:
Defined within a <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML file.

    Advantages:
    asy to use for single-page styling; keeps CSS and HTML together.

    Disadvantages:
    Not reusable across multiple pages; can make HTML files bulky.


External css:
 Defined in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML file using a <link> tag.

    Advantages:
    Reusable across multiple pages; keeps HTML clean and separates content from design.

    Disadvantages:
    Requires an additional HTTP request; not ideal for small projects or single-page sites.
