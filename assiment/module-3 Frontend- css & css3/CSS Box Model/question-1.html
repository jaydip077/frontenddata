Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border, 
margin). How does each affect the size of an element?  
 
--.->The CSS box model describes how elements are rendered and how their size is calculated in CSS. Each element is made up of four main components:

1.Content
The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.). Its size is set by properties like width and height.

2.Padding
The space between the content and the border. Padding increases the space inside the element, making it appear larger.

3.Border
The line that wraps around the padding and content. The border's thickness adds to the element's overall size.

4.Margin
The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements. Margins do not affect the element’s box size but affect the distance between elements. Each component adds to the total size of the element as follows:
Total Element Size = Content Size + Padding + Border + Margin
