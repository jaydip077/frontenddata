<!-- 
 What is the difference between border-box and content-box box-sizing in CSS? 


border-box:
    The width and height include the content, padding, and border. The total size stays the same, and padding/border are drawn inside the specified width/height.

box-sizing:
    The width and height properties apply only to the content. Padding and border are added outside the content area, increasing the total size.


  Which is the default? 

The default value is content-box.
