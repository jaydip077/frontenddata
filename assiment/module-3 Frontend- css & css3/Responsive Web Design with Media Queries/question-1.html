<!-- What are media queries in CSS.
 

Media queries are a CSS feature that allow you to apply different styles to a webpage depending on the device’s characteristics, such as:

->Screen size (width/height)

->Device type (screen, print, etc.)

->Orientation (portrait or landscape)

Resolution or pixel density

They are a key part of making responsive web designs — websites that look good on all devices (phones, tablets, desktops).

<!-- why are they important for responsive design?

Media queries are essential for making web pages look good and function well on all types of devices — from large desktop screens to small mobile phones.

1. They Make Layouts Flexible

Without media queries, a website would look the same on every screen — which can cause:
Text to be too small on phones
Images or buttons to overflow
Layouts to break
 
2. They Improve User Experience

Users expect websites to be:
Easy to read
Simple to navigate
Visually balanced

Media queries help you achieve that by:
Enlarging text or buttons on smaller screens
Rearranging sections vertically instead of horizontally
Hiding unnecessary elements on small devices

3. They Enhance Performance
By tailoring what’s shown on different devices, you can:
Hide heavy images on mobile
Reduce animations on low-power devices
Simplify layouts for faster loading
This improves both speed and efficiency.

4. They Ensure Cross-Device Compatibility

Your site should look good on:
Desktops 
Tablets 
Phones 
Even TVs or smartwatches 
Media queries allow you to set specific rules for each device type or size, ensuring consistent branding and usability.

5. They Support Modern Web Design Standards

Responsive design isn’t just a trend — it’s a requirement.
Google even uses mobile-friendliness as a ranking factor for SEO.
Media queries are the foundation of responsive design because they adapt your CSS based on the screen environment.
